*This project was developed as an assignment for the ssy class at BUT FEEC University.*
# SSY-HX711_LWM
Creation of school project, with HX711 sensor, ATmega256RFR2 in C library which allows user to measure weight and send it via uart and lwm network. Task was to use controller, connect HX711 and load cells (used 4 load cells).
###Assignment:
-Study datasheet of HX 711 https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf
-Implement function for reading weights in C code by datasheet (example)
-Design connection of load cells and use 1 or 2 axis.
